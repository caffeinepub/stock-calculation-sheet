  "architectural_notes": [
    "All quantity/weight inputs and displayed totals should use fixed 3-decimal formatting (0.000).",
    "Totals and closing stock must recalculate automatically when any row value changes.",
    "Layout should be responsive and visually similar to a simple Excel sheet.",
    "Printing should use print-only CSS to force a single-page A5 output (e.g., @page size A5, controlled margins) and scale/layout (side-by-side tables with manageable gaps) so all content fits on one page without changing the normal on-screen layout.",
    "Quantity/weight inputs must allow user entry and display values to exactly 3 decimal places (0.000) consistently across all fields and totals."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Totals below each section are not visible because the totals text color is white; change totals text to black (or otherwise ensure sufficient contrast).",
    "Number formatting is incorrect; inputs and displayed values are not consistently using 3-decimal (0.000) formatting as required.",
    "Current print layout is unacceptable; the full table content is not fitting onto a single A5 sheet as required."
